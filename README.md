# Projects
## Capstone Project - Malaria Detection using Machine Learning model
![Parasitic_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03ab4689-92f7-43f4-87b3-a28aab754735)

*	Utilized Python to analyze 28000 images to build a ML model with accuracy of over 98%.
*	Implemented data cleaning, standardization methods using Python packages. 
*	Normalized the images, Smoothen the images using an Average function. Converted the images to HSV scale.
*	Used Gaussian Blurring to improve model performance
*	Used OneHot encoding and Data Augmentation to Train the model.
*	Used CNN model( 13-21 layers) to train the model.
*	Ran multiple iterations with different Convolution layers, MaxPooling variable, Dropout layers , Loss Functions and Activation function.
